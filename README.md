# Customer-Lifetime-Value-Analytics

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis is a method used to estimate the total revenue a business can expect from a single customer account throughout the entirety of their relationship with the company.
Details:- 
  1. Total Revenue per Customer: The sum of all transaction amounts per customer.
     SELECT CustomerID, SUM(TransactionAmount) AS TotalRevenue
     FROM Transactions
     GROUP BY CustomerID;
     
  2. Purchase Frequency: The number of purchases per customer over a specific period.
     SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) AS PurchaseFrequency
     FROM Transactions
     GROUP BY CustomerID;
     
  3. Average Purchase Value: The average transaction amount per purchase for each customer.
     SELECT CustomerID, AVG(TransactionAmount) AS AvgPurchaseValue
     FROM Transactions
     GROUP BY CustomerID;

1. Calculate Customer Lifetime Value
    CLV=(Average Purchase Value×Purchase Frequency)−Acquisition Cost.

      SELECT 
          CustomerID,
          AVG(TransactionAmount) AS AvgPurchaseValue,
          COUNT(*) AS PurchaseFrequency,
          (AVG(TransactionAmount) * COUNT(*)) - MIN(AcquisitionCost) AS CLV
         FROM 
          Transactions
         GROUP BY 
          CustomerID;

 2. Segment customers into groups (e.g., high, medium, low value) to tailor marketing strategies and customer relationship efforts.
      SELECT CustomerID, CLV,
       CASE
           WHEN CLV >= 1000 THEN 'High Value'
           WHEN CLV BETWEEN 500 AND 999 THEN 'Medium Value'
           ELSE 'Low Value'
       END AS CLVSegment
      FROM CLVTable;
